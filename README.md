YOU RUN THE CODE BY CALLING MAKE ALL AND ./PROJECT1 "FILENAME"
I DID NOT FIND ANY BUGS
THERE ARE ONLY THE NORMAL LIBRAIRES
I USED MY LINKED LIST FROM PROJECT0 AND CHANGED IT TO SUIT WHAT I NEEDED.
IN THIS PROJECT I TOOK IN A FILE WITH P LITTLE P AND N P WAS IGNORED ON THIS ONE LITTLE P WAS THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PID AND N IS THE NUMBER OF TOTAL PID BURST AND PRIORITY LINES. I THEN TOOK IN AND STORED PID BURST AND PRIORITY FOR EACH LINE INTO A LINK IN A LINKED LIST. I THEN RAN CALCULATIONS ON THESE NUMBERS WHILE USING THE NUMBERS BEFORE TO GET THE NUMBER OF CONTEXT SWITCHES, NON CONTEXT SWITCHES, CPU UTILIZATION, THROUGHPUT, AVERAGE TURNAROUND TIME, AVERAGE WAITING TIME, AVERAGE WAITING TIME, AND AVERAGE RESPONSE TIME. TO GET NUMBER OF CONTEXT SWITCHES I COUNTED THE NUMBER OF CHANGES THAT WAS THE LAST OCCURANCE OF THE NUMBER. TO GET THE NUMBER OF NON VOLENTARY I COUNTED THE NUMBER OF CHANGES THAT WERE NOT THE SAME AND NOT THE LAST OCCURANCE. CPU UTILIZATION WAS GIVEN. THOUGHPUT IS TOTAL BURST / NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL PID OR LITTLE P. TURNAROUND TIME IS THE COMPLETION TIME FOR EACH PID / LITTLE P. WAITING TIME IS START TIME FOR EACH PID / LITTLE P. RESPONSE TIME IS BURST TIME - ARRIVAL TIME / LITTLE P.
